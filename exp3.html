            John Ray FRS (29 November 1627 â€“ 17 January 1705) was a Christian English naturalist widely regarded as one of the earliest of the English parson-naturalists.<br>
             Until 1670, he wrote his name as John Wray. <br>
             From then on, he used 'Ray', after "having ascertained that such had been the practice of his family before him". He published important works on botany, zoology, and natural theology.<br>
             His classification of plants in his Historia Plantarum, was an important step towards modern taxonomy. Ray rejected the system of dichotomous division by which species were classified by repeated sub-division into groups according to a pre-conceived series of characteristics they have or have not, <br>
             and instead classified plants according to similarities and differences that emerged from observation. He was among the first to attempt a biological definition for the concept of species, as "a group of morphologically similar organisms arising from a common ancestor".<br>
              Another significant contribution to taxonomy was his division of plants into those with two seedling leaves (dicotyledons) or only one (monocotyledons), a division used in taxonomy today.<br>
