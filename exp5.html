            Birbal Sahni was an Indian palaeobotanist who founded the Institute of Palaeobotany at Lucknow,<br>
             which was later renamed as Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeobotany after his death.<br>
             He was a pioneer in palaeobotanical research in India and was also a geologist who took an interest in archaeology.<br>
              Palaeobotany is the study of fossil plants, and his interest in the subject stemmed from his childhood fascination with plants, shells, and stones.<br>
               Born in late 19th century India, he was a bright and curious child who loved to explore and examine his surroundings. He grew up in an intellectually stimulating environment where his parents ensured that he received the best education possible.<br>
                After attending the Government College at Lahore where he studied botany under S. R. Kashyap, he moved to England to further his education. After earning his doctorate from the University of London in 1919, he briefly worked in Germany before returning to India.<br>
                 Soon he became the Head of the Botany Department of the Lucknow University and proved to be an excellent teacher with a great passion for palaeobotany. Soon he made the department an active centre for palaeobotanical research and also inspired his students to venture into the field. <br>
                 The establishment of the Institute of Palaeobotany was the culmination of his years of hard work though he unfortunately passed away just a week after the foundation stone laying ceremony<br>
